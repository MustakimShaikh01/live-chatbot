# 🤖 Live Chatbot using Python and NLTK

A smart chatbot project built using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This project demonstrates basic NLP techniques including tokenization, normalization, and response generation using rule-based logic.
## 📌 Overview

This chatbot simulates a human-like conversation using rule-based logic and natural language processing. It's ideal for students and developers who want to understand how NLP works and build intelligent systems using Python.

## 🎯 Features

- Text normalization (case conversion, punctuation removal)
- Tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK
- Pattern matching and response generation
- Simple and beginner-friendly structure
- Works offline (no API or database required)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**

## 🛠️ Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- pip (Python package manager)
